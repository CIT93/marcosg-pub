# To-Do List for Decision App

1. **Add Input Validation**: Enhance form input validation to prevent non-numeric values and unrealistic values (age > 120).
2. **Add Search Functionality**: Implement a search bar to allow users to search past entries based on age or membership status.
3. **Add Edit History**: Track changes made to each entry (e.g., keep a log of changes such as price updates) and display it in the app.
