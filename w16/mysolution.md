I will first ask the user if they have a dishwasher and a washing machine using Yes/No questions. If they say "Yes," I will then show a question asking how many times per week they use it. I will calculate the points separately for each machine based on their answer, and if they have both, I will add the points together. This way, the form only shows questions that are relevant to the user.

In my code, I will use if statements to check how many times the user uses each machine and assign points (3, 2, 1, or 0). If the user has both a dishwasher and a washing machine, I will calculate the points for each one and then add them together for the total.

essentially, coding it in the same way we have coded the rest of them. I belive it will be just as simple as the other.
